# Handle all of our Database stuff

# Things we will handle
# Making sure the database exists. If it doesn't create it. 
# Searching through the database to find the files we want
# Adding items to the database when we index a directory
# Removing items from the database if they no longer exist. Not to sure on how I'd like to handle this one.
